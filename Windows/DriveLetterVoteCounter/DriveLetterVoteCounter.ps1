# Name:		Drive Letter Vote Counter
# Purpose: 	Script for determining which drive letters should correspond to what
#			shared network resource. Best for "organizations" that don't know
#			what the word means, and who's drive mappings are all over the
#			place, and for whom their systems administrator holds justified
#			contempt for having to tie it all back up. This is for you, sysadmin.
